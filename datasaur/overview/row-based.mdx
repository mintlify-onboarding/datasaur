## Row-based

**Row-based** allows you to label data in tables on a row-by-row basis. This is commonly used for classification or data extraction.

Unlike token-based labeling, you label entire sentence(s) by answering the questions about each row. If your data is already in a table format (ex: `.xls` or `.csv`), you will be automatically guided to select row-based.
