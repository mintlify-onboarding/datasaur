## Span-based

**Span-based** or **Token-Based** projects allow you to label tokens in a text document. This type is well-suited for projects, such as [NER](/datasaur/overview/task-type/project-templates#named-entity-recognition) and [POS](/datasaur/overview/task-type/project-templates#part-of-speech).

Before submitting your project, you can also adjust additional settings as described below.

* **Limit selection to a maximum of 1 token** is useful when you want to enforce that every token in the document must be labeled.

* **Tokens and token spans should have at most one label** does not allow you to add multiple labels to a single token or token span.

* **Allow arrows to be drawn between labels** allows you to draw arrows from one label to another to annotate relationships between words. This is useful for showing that an adjective is related to a noun, or a pronoun is referring to a person.

* **Default text** selection allows you to select whether token or character selection. Some languages may require you to change the selection to character selection, i.e. Mandarin, Korean, or Thai.

<Info>
    Aside from NER and POS, [audio labeling](/datasaur/overview/task-type/span-based/audio-project) is another type of token-based labeling. The main difference is that an audio interface utilizes a waveform to display the audio and allows for the modification of timestamps.
