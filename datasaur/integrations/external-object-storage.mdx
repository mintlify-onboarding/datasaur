title: "External Object Storage"
---

This integration allows you to create projects using your preferred cloud storage provider. You will have a control over access from Datasaur to your object storage.

This will be very beneficial for **doc-based** and **bounding-box project** because Datasaur only saves questions and answers (without the file data) from the project.

But for both token-based and row-based, the data is still being processed and copied to our database. We're still working to also make these types supported.

**Project Creation Wizard**

You can select your preferred object storage on the first step just like figure below. Datasaur will not copy the files that are selected.
