description: "Data labeling is a key step in training supervised learning AI algorithms. There are three main components for labeling data: the data to be labeled, the label set (sometimes referred to as the _ontology_ or _taxonomy_), and the people who perform the labeling (sometimes referred to as _labelers_, _taggers_ or _annotators_)."

Datasaur is a web-based software platform that allows you to upload the data, apply the labels and collaborate with your labeling team. We focus on improving efficiency and quality while ensuring data security.

Datasaur supports the most common forms of Natural Language Processing (NLP) labeling:
