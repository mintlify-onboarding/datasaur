Datasaur has a robust security measures and compliance standards to protect your valuable data because we take this matter seriously. We understand the importance of maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your information, and we take extensive measures to ensure a secure environment for your annotation needs.

## Data Encrypted at Rest

To provide a high level of protection, all data stored within our platform is fully encrypted at rest. This means that your sensitive information remains secure even when stored on our servers, providing an added layer of defense against unauthorized access.

## Compliance

We recognize the significance of industry compliance in maintaining the trust and confidence of our users. Datasaur is proud to adhere to stringent security and privacy standards, including **SOC 2 Type II** and **HIPAA**. These certifications validate our commitment to implementing comprehensive security controls, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

To further enhance the security of your account, we offer Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) as an additional layer of protection, specifically a **Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP)**. 2FA adds an extra step to the login process, requiring users to provide a second form of verification with a unique code generated by an authenticator app, in addition to their regular login credentials. This helps prevent unauthorized access even if login credentials are compromised.

## Self-Hosted

We also offer self-hosted options for organizations that require even greater control over their data and infrastructure. Our self-hosted solutions allow you to host the app within your own secure environment, giving you complete control and customization while still benefiting from the powerful annotation capabilities of our platform. If you are interested in exploring self-hosted options, please reach out to support@datasaur.ai for more detailed information.
