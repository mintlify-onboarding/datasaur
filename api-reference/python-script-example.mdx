title: "Python Script Example"
---

## Usage Requirement

* This feature will only work in a [**team workspace**](/datasaur/workspace-management/workspace).

* pip3 and python3 CLI installed on the machine.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this [repository](https://github.com/datasaur-ai/api-client-example) and go to the directory.

2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

## Guide

#### 1\. Generate your OAuth credentials

The instructions can be found [here](/datasaur/api/credentials). Save the credentials securely, we will use it for the next step.

#### 2\. Set up a project via Custom Project

We have five steps here. Set up your project until reaching Step 5 (Project Settings). Make sure all the configuration that you want for the project is set properly.

#### 3\. In the Step 5, click “View Script” in the top right corner

#### 5\. Paste the configuration to project\_configuration.json

The file is located on the `api-client-example/create-project-async` folder.

#### 6\. Insert your dataset for the project in the `api-client-example/create-project-async/documents` folder

All files inside the folder will be treated as the project's documents. Make sure you remove any files that doesn't belong to the project.

#### 7\. Run the command on your terminal to create the project

Navigate to `api-client-example/create-project-async` first before running the command. Note that this API only submit a job, not a synchronous process. Thus, we need to make sure whether the job is successful which will be covered in the next step.

```bash
python3 api_client.py create_project \
  --base_url https://app.datasaur.ai \
  --client_id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client_secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
  --team_id YOUR_TEAM_ID
 
# for windows replace \ with ^
```

#### 8\. Run this command to track your project creation status

The `job_id` will be given at the previous step along with the full command as the response. The detailed of this API could be seen [here](/datasaur/api/get-data/check-job).

```bash
python3 api_client.py get_job_status \
  --base_url https://app.datasaur.ai \
  --client_id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client_secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
  --job_id YOUR_JOB_ID
 
# for windows replace \ with ^ 
```

With these instructions, you can successfully create a new project by using a Python script via API.
